## Tortoise TTS-Geneface++-FastSpeech2HS

- I used Tortoise TTS to generate English audio, which I then downloaded and processed with GeneFace++ for lip-syncing to a face.
- I followed the same process for Hindi text, using FastSpeech2 HS TTS for Hindi audio. In both cases, I used Theresa May's face for the lip-syncing in the generated videos.
- All codes were executed in ipynb files.
