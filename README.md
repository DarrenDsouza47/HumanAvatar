## Tortoise TTS-Geneface++-FastSpeech2HS

- Used tortoise tts for generating english audio which i then downloaded and passed to geneface++ which performed the lip sync to the face.
- Same process for hindi text but using fastspeech2 HS tts for hindi language.
- I used theresa may face for generating the video sync on both videos.
- All codes were executed in ipynb files.
